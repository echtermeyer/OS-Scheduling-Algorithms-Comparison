	abstract = {Reviews literature on the dual coding theory (DCT) of memory and cognition, beginning with the origin and development of DCT from 1963 to 1986. General and specific criticisms of DCT and research findings are also addressed, focusing on alternative views that emphasize abstract propositional representations as the basis of cognition. The review deals with the origins of DCT in research related to the conceptual peg hypothesis of concreteness and imagery effects on associative memory. The review also discusses empirical and conceptual responses to recent criticisms of DCT and alternative theoretical views in areas related to concreteness effects on memory, schema theory, and conceptual issues in the philosophy of science.

	abstract = {Cognitive load theory uses evolutionary theory to consider human cognitive architecture and uses that architecture to devise novel, instructional procedures. The theory assumes that knowledge can be divided into biologically primary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire and biologically secondary knowledge that is important for cultural reasons. Secondary knowledge, unlike primary knowledge, is the subject of instruction. It is processed in a manner that is analogous to the manner in which biological evolution processes information. When dealing with secondary knowledge, human cognition requires a very large information store, the contents of which are acquired largely by obtaining information from other information stores. Novel information is generated by a random generate and test procedure with only very limited amounts of novel information able to be processed at any given time. In contrast, very large amounts of organized information stored in the information store can be processed in order to generate complex action. This architecture has been used to generate instructional procedures, summarized in this chapter.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the multimedia learning. Multimedia learning occurs when a learner builds a mental representation from words and pictures that have been presented. For purposes of research program, multimedia instructional messages are presentations of material using words and pictures that are intended to foster learning. The pictures can be static graphics such as photos, drawings, maps, charts, figures, and tables or dynamic graphics such as video or animation. Multimedia learning occurs if one constructs a mental representation of the lightning system based on the words and pictures in the multimedia instructional message. In this case, one must build a cause-and-effect model of how a change in one part of the system causes a principle-based change in another part, and so on. For example, when cool air comes over a warm surface, the cool air becomes heated and rises.},
